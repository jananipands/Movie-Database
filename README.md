# Movie-Database
This is a movie database. The user enters the name of the file with the list of movies, separated by commas,
with the following information: the title, gross total in billions, director(s), release date, and run time in minutes.
The program will grab the input from the file and store it into an array of structs. Upon user request, the program will
retrieve the correlating information of the movie they choose to retrieve. The program also gives the option of saving the 
user favorites into a text file, favorites.txt.
